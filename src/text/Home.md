## About me

Hey there! My name is Kristian, and I'm a software engineer living in Helsinki, Finland. Originally I'm from the small town of [TÃ³rshavn, Faroe Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C3%B3rshavn)

As many people in my generation, I grew up right around the time that social media sites started to become common and popular. Think MySpace. Back then it was common that users could create their own profile using HTML, CSS and even JavaScript! Copying snippets that I didn't understand, playing around, and just having fun was what got me interested in computer programming in the first place.

Today I work as an engineering team lead at Wolt. I believe that an engineering manager's job is to create a supportive, productive, and enjoyable work environment, and I strive to foster a culture of trust, respect, and continuous learning.

In the past, I worked as a React Native developer at Wolt, where I developed and maintained the Wolt Partner app. I have also worked as a GIS consultant and a web consultant, and I have a passion for front-end development and JavaScript.

In my free time, I love playing board games and doing various sports, such as biking, running and weight lifting.
