## About me

Hi, my name is Kristian. I am a software engineer living in Helsinki, Finland.

I am currently working at as frontend competence lead and React Native developer at [Wolt](https://wolt.com/).

As a React Native developer I am responsible for developing and maintaining our Wolt Partner app, which supports the livelihood of tens of thousands of courier partners.

As frontend competence lead my job includes many different things. At Wolt one of our biggest export is frontend related code, and we have many projects spanning across multiple programming languages, frameworks and platforms. What I do is to facilitate frontend-related knowledge sharing, documentation and in general to be there for people who would like some help. Another of my big focuses has to do with onboarding and mentorship. I'm dedicated to making sure that everyone should be able to get the help and support they need within the frontend part of our organization.

In the past I have worked as a GIS consultant and a web consultant, and I have always had a special place in my heart for all things JavaScript.

In my free time I have been known to dabble in nerdy things like board games, biking and boffering.
